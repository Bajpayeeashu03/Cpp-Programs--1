Program 1:
Write a C++ program to show the creation and destruction of objects. Assign a name
to each object so that it becomes easier to identify which object gets created and which gets destroyed.

Program 2:
Class multiplier has a function to multiply two variables. Implement this using template class so that the multiply 
function can multiply variables for different Datatype.

Program 3:
Class multiplier has a function to multiply two variables. Implement this using template class so that the multiply 
function can multiply variables for Same Datatype.

Program 4:
Class "Account" has the provision to accept multiple account numbers from a single person and store the balance of each account.
Member function "transfer" can transfer the balance of one account to another. Write a C++ program to implement the same using the concept 
of passing the object of a class as a function parameter. Practice the program by passing the object once by value, once by address and once by reference.
